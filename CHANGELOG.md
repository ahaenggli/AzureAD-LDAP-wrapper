## [Unreleased] (in 'dev')


## [1.8.0] - 2022-07-09

### Changed

- Reset .cache folder owner every time the container is started
- Use the SIDs for users/groups from Azure instead of a "randomly" generated one.
However, you can enable the old handling by setting the env var `LDAP_SAMBA_USEAZURESID` to `false`.

### Added
- support for proxies (env var `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY`)

## [1.7.0] - 2022-03-19

### Changed

- to support #ext#-users the following changes were necessary:
  - added ldap attribute `AzureADuserPrincipalName` with the original AAD-User (for login/password check in the AAD)
  - allowed domain mismatch for AD-Domain and LDAP-Domain
  - try binding via `AzureADuserPrincipalName` if no entry for `uid`/`dn` is found
  - env var `GRAPH_FILTER_USERS` to filter user entries in graph using the [$filter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters#filter-parameter) query parameter  
  (default is set to `userType eq 'Member'`, so external users (guests) will not be synced automatically by default)
  - env var `GRAPH_FILTER_GROUPS` to filter group entries in graph using the [$filter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters#filter-parameter) query parameter  
  (e.g. set it to `securityEnabled eq true` so only security groups will be sync and not every teams-group)
- SID calculation for users is now `sambaSID: fixedBase + "-" + (uidNumber * 2 + 1000)`
- SID calculation for groups is now `sambaSID: fixedBase + "-" + (gidNumber * 2 + 1001)`

### Added

- support #ext#-users (guest users from other `ExternalAzureAD`)
- add ldap attribute `sambaPrimaryGroupSID` for users
- optional env var `LDAP_SAMBADOMAINNAME` to manually set the sambaDomainName attribute in the LDAP
- optional env var `SAMBA_BASESID` to overwrite the fixed base SID

### Fixed

- documentation for join a device with a non AAD user
- handle for @odata.nextLink in graph responses (should fix parts of #14)
- converted schema csv files from utf-16 to utf-8
- handle cn=subschema like any other ldap entries instead of fixed search attributes
- register an error handler for the server (EventEmitter)
- escape LDAP special chars `,=+<>#;\` with an additional backslash

## [1.6.0] - 2021-12-19

### Changed

- Switched from @azure/ms-rest-nodeauth to @azure/Identity (ADAL to MSAL)
~~[Treat application as a public client](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Username-Password-Authentication#application-registration) may be set to `true`~~  
Set [Allow public client flows](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Username-Password-Authentication#application-registration) to `Yes` and add the permission `User.Read` for `Delegated`  in your Azure Portal or you can't login anymore. The settings are described with some images in the [README](README.md#how-to-use-it).  
Those changes were necessary to use MSAL instead of ADAL.

### Added

- handler to add new ldap entries
- handler to remove/delete new ldap entries
- handler to modify/edit ldap entires

## [1.5.0] - 2021-10-07

### Added

- env var `LDAP_SYNC_TIME` to set the interval for fetching users/groups from azure database. Default is 30 minutes. (thx @oleksandr-mazur)
- env var `DSM7` to activate the DSM 7 workaround. It handles gidNumber and uidNumber as integers instead of strings.
- Handler to use custom JavaScript to modify your ldap attributes  
This allows you e.g. to filter your azure user/groups or modify the ldap attributes. This method is also used in the DSM7 workaround.
Look at [this](./customizer/customizer_DSM7_IDs_string2int.js) file for an example. Customize it as you need and map the file in your docker setup as `/app/customizer/ldap_customizer.js`.

## [1.4.0] - 2021-07-25

### Added

- entry point for customizable schema modifications

### Changed

- Changed the "sambaDomainName" attribute to be in upper case to respect the standard configuration of samba configs. (thx @DreydenGys)

## [1.3.1] - 2021-07-15

### Fixed

- gidNumber and uidNumber are strings again

## [1.3.0] - 2021-07-13

### Added/Fixed

- more schema data to avoid errors in DSM 7
  (ldap schema data was extracted from syno directory server)
- sambaDomainName is now part of the ldap schema information

### Changed

- merge ldap entries with matching entryUUIDs
- removed subschemaSubentry and hasSubordinates values from ldap entries

### Security

- npm dependencies updated

## [1.2.0] - 2021-04-15

### Added

- "rename" group if another with same entryUID exists

### Changed

- groups `entryDN`:
  - replace accents with the latin alternatives
   (ç -> c, è -> e, ö -> o, ...)
  - replace non alpha-numeric chars with dashes

## [1.1.0] - 2021-04-06

### Added

- limit the time a cached sambaNTPassword hash can be used with env var `LDAP_SAMBANTPWD_MAXCACHETIME`
- entryUID and osx-attributes for ldap entries
- "rename" user if another with same entryUID exists
- LDAPS (LDAP over SSL) support

### Changed

- the docker image is now using tini (nodejs is not running as PID 1 anymore)
- always log 30 minutes refresh info (to be sure it's still running)

## [1.0.2] - 2021-04-02

### Fixed

- format logs
- distinct user membership (user could be in same group multiple times due to wrong creation/edit)

### Security

- no login from cache for inactive users

## [1.0.1] - 2021-04-02

### Added

- more logs for debugging

### Fixed

- users without groups

## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-31

### Added

- new environment variable to allow login from cached sambaNTPassword
`LDAP_ALLOWCACHEDLOGINONFAILURE`, default: true
if set to true and the login is failed, the login is retried against the sambaNTPassword, except the error says "wrong credentials".
(useful for unstable internet connection)
- this CHANGELOG file

### Changed

- README file (more samples, map-folder)
- errors are always logged
- allow multiple bind-user (ex. ldapsearch1|mysecret||searchy2|othersecret)

### Fixed

- load existing db on startup-error (ex. unstable internet connection)

### Security

- sambaNTPassword can only be accessed from defined LDAP_BINDUSER and on accessing your own entries (userA can only access userA-sambaNTPassword, LDAP_BINDUSER-user can access all sambaNTPasswords)

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2021-03-27

### Added

- LDAP server
- AzureAD Connection
- Dockerfile
- Container on hub.docker.cm
